      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Our advanced algorithms analyze PDF documents to detect patterns and characteristics commonly found in AI-generated text. The system examines multiple factors including:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        <li class="mb-2">Language patterns and variability</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Structural consistency</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Contextual relevance</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Semantic coherence</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Stylistic markers</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        After analysis, each document receives a classification along with a detailed report explaining the findings.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">Level 1: Clean</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Documents classified as "Clean" show no detectable signs of AI involvement. These documents are likely to be entirely human-created and demonstrate natural language patterns, inconsistencies, and stylistic elements typical of human writing.

        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          "AI-Supported" documents show evidence of AI assistance but also substantial human input. This might include documents where AI was used for research, outlining, or editing, but significant human creativity and effort are still evident.

        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Documents classified as "AI-Generated" show strong indicators of being primarily created by AI with minimal human editing. These typically exhibit patterns, structures, and language characteristics common to large language models.
